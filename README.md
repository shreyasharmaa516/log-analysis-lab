# 🔍 Log Analysis Lab

A beginner-friendly Python project that scans a sample log file for suspicious activity using simple keyword matching.


## 📂 Files Included

- `log_scanner.py` – Python script that searches for common threat indicators in logs
- `sample_log.txt` – Sample log file with mixed activity (normal + suspicious)


## 🚀 How It Works

The script:
1. Reads through the sample log line by line
2. Flags lines containing keywords like `failed`, `unauthorized`, `denied`, `error`, etc.
3. Prints out only the suspicious entries


## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Used

- Python programming
- Log file analysis
- Basic cybersecurity scripting
- Threat detection logic


## 🎯 Purpose

This project is part of my **Blue Team learning path**. It demonstrates:
- How logs play a crucial role in incident detection
- How even simple scripting can uncover potential threats
- My commitment to learning defensive cybersecurity


## 📈 Future Goals

- Expand this script with regex-based detection
- Add log parsing from `.log` or `.csv` files
- Improve false positive handling
